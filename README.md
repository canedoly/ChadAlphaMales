# ChadAlphaMales (fixed)

If there's a problem with the cheat, please make a github issue and i'll try to fix it.

For DT use 19-20 ticks because of the anti warp.

# Known Issues with this version of CAM

Anti warp is not the best, but it kinda does the job.

# old readme
Feel free to add me on discord zphr#0365 or make a new issue if you have any questions

The source code is utterly shit compared to my new project (private atm, might release it some day to public but not open-source)

The offsets are fucked from the june (?) + january update, feel free to fix it yourself and make a pull request or fork it and continue it by yourself (most likely won't notice it)

Have fun with the semi-old src code (IIRC 1.7 or 1.8 was the latest), the development has been discontinued since february due to lots of funny stuff that happened between me and legacy.
